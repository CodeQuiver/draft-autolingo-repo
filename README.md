# draft-autolingo-repo

This is the draft of a partially done group project. The project was to create a translation app that uses first the google translate API, then the text-to-speech engine, to allow a user to have the app translate a phrase and then speak it out loud in the target language for them. 

So, for example, the user enters "What time is it?" and the app speaks out loud "Quelle heure est-il?".
